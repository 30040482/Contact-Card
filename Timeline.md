Summer 2025

Before SRJC, I was of testing, troubleshooting, advertising, and selling VR/AR hardware and software (Oculus, HTC, Index,
HP Z VR; HP Reverb, Pico, Steam VR, Enklu Cloud, Microsoft HoloLens, Viconâ€™s Evoke etc.) while repairing and
providing maintenance to proprietary VR technologies provided by startup companies across San Francisco such as The Void VR, BlackBox VR, Gameday VR, Sandbox VR, Oculus VR, Enklu Inc, Niantic, and Facebook/Meta.

It was a career that had me fired the first day I moved into my apartment and later evicted on my birthday.

All while navigating through instances of DARVO and Munchausen by Proxy from direct family members and students.

Now, I'm a new student at Santa Rosa Junior College, and a returning member to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I'm prepping for their debut artificial intelligence course, BAD 81, after having met DeepLearning.AI's CEO, Andrew Ng, as a result of completeing another debut AI class in Oakland, CA; CIS 96F. As well as dropping a Starbucks barista role during a ransomeware attack that froze the company's Blue Yonder payment systems at their Lake Park store, and exiting from a non-profit organization; Poor Magazine.

Currently in the process to interview for a job with the Financial Aid Office.

Update on any anomalies tomorrow.
